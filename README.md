# Project week 5 | Sports Coach Website

A sports coach has ordered a site to highlight his professional activity. This coach offers home musculation, fitness, combat sports and wants a showcase for his activity.

To do this you will produce a modern and responsive site using Bootstrap.

This site will contain at least the following pages:

     Homepage.
     presentaion page.
     Price page.
     Contact page.

In the pages you will appear as you wish the following elements:

     A slider with images that parade
     A contact form
     An agenda to see the availability of the coach
     A Google map
     Bootstrap cards
